<p class="description-para">A delicious mac and cheese recipe with bacon.</p>
<ul class="ingredients-list">
   <li>1 3/4 cups Macaroni, uncooked</li>
   <li>3 Tbls of Butter or Margarine</li>
   <li>2 Tbls of Flour</li>
   <li>2 Cups of Milk, or as needed</li>
   <li>2 Cups Kraft Shredded Sharp Cheedar Cheese, divided</li>
   <li>3 Slices of Oscar Mayer Center Cut Bacon, cooked, crumbled</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol class="steps-list">
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and keep warm.</li>
    <li>At the same time, melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until mixture becomes paste-like and bubbly, about 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook and stir until the mixture is thick and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in 1 1/2 cups Cheddar and cook until melted, about 5 minutes.

</li>
    <li>Add macaroni and bacon to the saucepan; gently stir to combine with sauce. Add additional milk only if needed to evenly coat the pasta. Transfer to a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish; sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar over top.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 20 minutes.</li>
